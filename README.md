## Description
The goal of this project is to create a backend to allow the e-commerce site to add, remove and update products in the e-commerce site. This application will use Express.js/MYSQL/Sequelize to develop the backend. The app will not be deployed on heroku or github pages. Routes will have to be tested on Insomnia or Thunderclient on VSCode.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
